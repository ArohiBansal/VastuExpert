**Example Interaction**
User: "What is the best direction for the main entrance of my house?"

Chatbot: "The main entrance of the house should ideally face east or north to attract positive energy and good fortune. These directions are considered auspicious as they bring in natural sunlight and enhance prosperity."

User: "My kitchen is in the northeast corner. Is that good according to Vastu?"

Chatbot: "According to Vastu, having a kitchen in the northeast is not ideal, as it conflicts with the elemental balance. The northeast is associated with water, while the kitchen is connected with fire. Consider moving the kitchen to the southeast or northwest, or placing a Vastu remedy like a mirror or colors to mitigate the imbalance."
